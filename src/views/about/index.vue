        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>We are a team of dedicated whistleblowers aiming to expose the treachery that is the sad-girl company: Phase Connect. Through our many years of journalism (November 1st, 2024 - Present Day) we have come into contact with several scandals from a plethora of V-Tuber companies. However, they all pale in comparison to Phase Connect. With our insider knowledge and years of industry experience, we aim to show the world just how devious this company truly is.</p>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Weâ€™ll expose the hidden truths, systemic issues, and behind-the-scenes decisions that impact creators, employees, and audiences alike. From company espionage to the controversial talent history, there's much to uncover behind the facade Phase Connect tries so desperately to keep up. Stay tuned as we'll keep you up-to-date on the most drama inducing stories this company has to offer. </p>
        <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>In all seriousness, this is just a satirical site. Inspired by the likes of The Onion, I've always wanted to run some sort of gag site and so I said "Why not do one on Phase Connect?" so I built this. None of these articles are meant to be taken literally and aren't aimed to attack anyone or any company. With that said, I hope these articles provide some form of entertainment for you! :)</p>
